This is used to convert the .dng file downloaded from HDR+ to uncompressed DNG file


Download Data 
0. mkdir data
1. Follow instruction in 
    http://www.hdrplusdata.org/dataset.html
   Note that the entire data set is huge. I only downloaded 20171106_subset/bursts/0006_20160727_185921_651
   for testing. 
   Make sure data is in data/20171106_subset/bursts/{:imageId}
2. Run DNG converter to convert all payload_N00x.dng file to uncompressed dng files and save as 
    payload_N00x_uncompressed.dng
